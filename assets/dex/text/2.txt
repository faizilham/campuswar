<b>Squidtron, the Informers</b><br/>
A Campusian deity known by it’s cleverness and tricky nature, the Informo is a race who live in a ‘stateless’ region. The region of Digitron, a region of no physical form and strangely led to another dimension. No one has ever truly know about this region, let alone the race. They live from an energy source that originates from other world surprisingly connected to Campus. This region, by its nature, has it’s own set of way about how things work, ignoring the planet common way. Thus, the Informos is able to manipulate the state of everything by digitalize them, rendering themselves practically invulnerable, as no attack or magic are bound to hurt them. The war hasn’t really affected the Informos, but as some race try to invade their homeland, the Informos, a solitary race, is not a kind who will face the visitor with warm welcoming. They will suck you to their world, to the region of Digitron, where they practically can move ultimately fast and attack you, without you even notice. But don’t think the Informos is only a might in their homeland. Sending their coldminded warrior, Squidtron, as their general, the Informos is one race to be watched.
